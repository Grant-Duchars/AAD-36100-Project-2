          You are an innocent. Your goal is to survive. You don't know the roles
          of other players and the traitors are coming to get you, but don't
          randomly take out other players because you could be removing
          teammates. Sus out the other players, find clues to potential
          suspects, or team up with the detective to survive.

        <p>
          You are the detective. Assist the innocents in taking down the
          traitors. Utilize different gadgets like the binoculors to identify
          bodies from afar, the dna scanner to hunt down the killer, or others
          from your detective shop. Be careful though as all other players know
          who you are and some of them do not want you carying out your job.
